Udacity FEND Project 1: Personal Blog

This is the first project from the Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree program.

The objective of this project was to demonstrate understanding of basic HTML and CSS layout techniques using a blend of Flexbox and CSS grid to create a resposive,
blog style web page. In addition to the home page, a sample blog page is also created to demonstrate what one would look like within the context of the site.

My aim for this project was to make an elegant, simplistic design and a moderately interactive UX without any additional JS or plug ins.
